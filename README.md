This is a 4th Semester Project from one of my courses: Research Methodology in Computer Science
For this course, my partner and I decided to create a detector for people who have sleep disorder using Artificial Neural Networks. 
Inside this repository, I included the final research paper, the source code, and the dataset from Kaggle. 
The libraries used in this project are pandas, numpy, sklearn, tensorflow, keras, imblearn, seaborn, and matplotlib.
The final accuracy for this project is 93.87%
